<h1>What is it?</h1>
It's a hero module that I(Anton) created after Jon McLaren showed the Figma File in the first "Coding with Jon: Let's Build a Website" episode. If you don't know what's it all about - here's the video:

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<p>Just use it as you would use a regular module. Just keep in mind that since it's a "hero" module it should be used once on a page.</p>
<p>If you like to use it several times, you'll most likely need to modify the JS part inside the module.html file</p>

<h3>Available options</h3>
<p>Please note that all colors and settings are taken from HubSpot so you'll need to adjust those to your needs</p>

<h2>Anything special?</h2>
<p>Since it was designed truely "by eye" without ever having access to the real Figma file and without seeing a tablet/mobile version - it's optimized for desktop and should be seen more as a "proof of concept" than a fully ready-to-use module. I(Anton) had the </p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
